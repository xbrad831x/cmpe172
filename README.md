## Getting Started with Ansible
This is a simple exercise to help us get acquainted with Ansible and its powerful configuration capabilities. To get started, [make sure you have Ansible installed](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html) on the OS of your choice.

In order to run a playbook, make sure you have the private key `test.pem` stored in your `~/Downloads` folder and use the following command:

~~~bash
$ ansible-playbook <play>.yml
~~~
